# Github Rulesets
Github rulesets define rules for interacting with a repository.  They are
intended to improve code quality through better code review and merging
practices.

A Github ruleset can be setup by importing a ruleset JSON file.
To setup a ruleset follow these steps:
* Navigate to the Github repository.
* Go to the settings tab.
* Expand the Rules section.
* Select Rulesets.
* Click the New Ruleset button.
* Select Import a ruleset.
* From the project directory select the `.github/settings/default_ruleset.json` file.
